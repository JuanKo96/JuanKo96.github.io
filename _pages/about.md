I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), advised by [Prof. Justin Domke](https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/domke-justin). 

My research interest lies in 
- Variational Inference and Stochastic Optimization
- Generative Models, with a focus on GFlowNets

I have a broad yet focused interest in the theoretical aspects of Variational Inference, particularly in high-capacity inference methods and constructing generative models such as GFlowNets. I am actively engaged in research with various groups, including the [DiffEqML](https://github.com/DiffEqML) research group, where I have deepened my interest in probabilistic machine learning. Before joining UMass, I completed my Master's in Industrial & Systems Engineering at KAIST under the supervision of [Prof. Woo Chang Kim](https://felab.kaist.ac.kr/team.html) and did my undergraduate at Yonsei University.
