I am a Master's student in the Industrial and Systems Engineering department at KAIST advised by [Prof. Woo Chang Kim](https://felab.kaist.ac.kr/team.html). My research interest lies in 
- Probabilitic Machine Learning 
- Bayesian Inference and Stochastic Optimization

I have a broad but focused interest in the theoretical aspects of Black-Box Variational Inference, GFlowNets, and Neural SDEs. I am involved in research with various groups, including the [DiffEqML](https://github.com/DiffEqML) research group, where my interest in probabilistic machine learning has deepened. Additionally, I had the valuable opportunity to visit Carnegie Mellon University and work with [Prof. Andrew A. Li](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aali1/index.html) last fall. Prior to KAIST, I did my undergraduate at Yonsei University.
